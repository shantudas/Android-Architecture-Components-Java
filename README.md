[Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) are a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. 
Android Architecture components is part of new [android jetpack components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) which is collection of libraries that are individually adoptable and built to work together.

## Android Architecture Components Libraries

* [Data Biniding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)-Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements
* [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle)-Manage your activity and fragment lifecycles
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)-Notify views when underlying database changes
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/)-Handle everything needed for in-app navigation
* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/)-Gradually load information on demand from your data source
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)-Fluent SQLite database access
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)-Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way
* [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/)-Manage your Android background jobs
